Dresscode is a great activity, but the objects are very small to little kids to cut out and manipulate. My daughter is 5 and loves your book and activities. This one she had trouble with. Both Ruby and her clothing should be much bigger. I can adjust and print bigger, but I am not sure if other parents can do the same..
